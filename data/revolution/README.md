## Revolutionary War participants
This dataset is drawn from the appendix of David Hackett Fischer's _Paul Revere's Ride_; a CSV version is available within
the repository https://github.com/kjhealy/revere.git. 

## Description
This is a bipartite graph representing colonial American dissidents' membership in seven Whig (anti-British) groups during the
buildup to the American Revolutionary War. 
See http://kieranhealy.org/blog/archives/2013/06/09/using-metadata-to-find-paul-revere/ and http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/chwe/ps269/han.pdf
for some analyses using this data.

For more traditional SNA applications, a one-mode projection of this data will yield a co-attendance network of the 254
examined Revolutionary War figures.

Graph properties:
   - Directed: False
   - Weighted: False
   - Multigraph: False
   - Bipartite: True

### Vertices
