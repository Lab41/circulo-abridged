## Summary

This directory contains links to various data sets and scrips to extract them into a format [readable by igraph](http://igraph.org/python/doc/tutorial/tutorial.html#igraph-and-the-outside-world). 

Each subdirectory's `run.py` provides the methods `get_graph()` and most provide `get_ground_truth()`. `get_graph` returns an igraph graph of the given data, described in the individual dataset's README. `get_ground_truth` returns a VertexClustering object of what we believe to be ground truth in the given data, again described in the specific README.

Running `python3 run.py` in some subdirectory will populate that directory with a new `data/` directory containing all relevant files, including a file in igraph-readable format.


## Adding a new dataset

To write an etl script for a new dataset, follow these steps. We'll pretend our new dataset is called "friends":

1. Create a new subdirectory with a name describing the new dataset: `mkdir friends`
2. Copy the etl template into the new directory, naming it `run.py`: `cp run_template.py friends/run.py`
2. Copy the README template into the new directory, naming it `README.md`: `cp README_template.md friends/README.md`
4. Implement all functions in `run.py`. If the file is already in igraph readable format, this should only involve changing the constants at the top of the file. Otherwise, you'll have to do the conversion yourself, in `__prepare__`.
5. Add an empty __init__.py to the subdirectory: `echo '' > friends/__init__.py`
5. Fill out the README
6. Add a row to the Progress table in this README.
